It's called swimming. - [laughs] I don't-- I don't believe you. \u266a\u266a\u266a - In the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets... but the darkest of them all may remain-- [singer vocalizing] the end of House Atreides. - Your father didn't believe in revenge. \u266a\u266a\u266a - What if Paul Atreides were still alive? [singer vocalizing] \u266a\u266a\u266a [vocalizing continues] [gasps] \u266a\u266a\u266a - Have you ever had a dream about your first ride?

Nothing's clear. \u266a\u266a\u266a You've been fighting the Harkonnens for decades. - Load! - My family's been fighting them for centuries. - Your blood comes from Dukes and Great Houses. Here, we're equal. What we do, we do for the benefit of all. - I'd very much like to be equal to you. - Maybe I'll show you the way. \u266a\u266a\u266a - Deal with this prophet. Send assassins. - Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic. [knife slashes] [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] - I see possible futures all at once, and in so many futures, our enemies prevail, but I do see a way. There is a narrow way through. \u266a\u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a\u266a My allegiance is to you. Do you believe me? \u266a\u266a\u266a - This is a form of power that our world has not yet seen-- the ultimate power. - I want you to know, I will love you as long as I breathe. - You will never lose me as long as you stay who you are. - Consider what you're about to do, Paul Atreides. - Silence! \u266a\u266a\u266a - This prophecy is how they enslave us! \u266a\u266a\u266a - Chani! \u266a\u266a\u266a - You are not prepared for what is to come. \u266a\u266a\u266a",
